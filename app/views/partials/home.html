<p>I'm a web developer, cook, musician &amp; amateur brewer of beer and kombucha.
    I live in Brooklyn, NY. and when not pursuing these ventures I enjoy cycling, reading, traveling and laughing at anything funny.
</p>
<p>I work at <a href="http://www.singhleplatform.com" target="_blank"><strong>SinglePlatform</strong></a> in NYC as a Software Engineer tackling as much JS and Python as I can take on.
    My last job in Boston was an exciting whirlwind of technologies.  This was <a href="http://www.nutraclick.com" target="_blank"><strong>NutraClick</strong></a> where I was a full stack developer tackling things small, large and extraordinary.
    The challenges encountered so far have strengthened my skills and solidified my commitment to becoming the most well rounded developer I can be.
    I've worked for a web development and design company located in New York - <a href="http://www.zooluweb.com" title="website design shop"><strong>Zoolu Web Solutions</strong></a>
    as well as a financial consulting firm <a href="http://www.truebridge.com"><strong>Truebridge</strong></a> expanding on a browser based CRM.
    These jobs complemented my learning while completing my CS degree from BU and playing as much music as I could.
</p>
<p>Most of my development is focused on delivering web applications using Python/Django, JS/Angular, SQL, HTML &amp; CSS.  In school and with any new jobs or ventures I always enjoying learning new
    languages, concepts, technologies, and design patterns.<br />
